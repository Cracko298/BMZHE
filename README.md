# Download:
- Lastest Version [Download](https://github.com/Cracko298/BMZHE/blob/main/BMZHE.zip?raw=true)

# Notes:
- Not an Advanced GUI. Uses ***Numpad Keys 0-3*** To Navigate Menu's.
- Edits ***ALL*** Save-Data Within The Current Directory.
- ***Only*** Edits BMZ Health.

# FaQ:
***Why is my Save-Data not Valid?***

- *The most Common reason is because the Save-Data isn't an Adventure Save.*

***Why isn't this a Save-Editor?***

- *The application only edit's Save-Data health. And nothing else.*

***Is BattleMiner (2014) Supported Yet?***

- *Not yet, however it is being planned to be supported very soon.*

***What is Error-Code "0x01"?***

- *This Error-Code only ever displays itself if No Save-Data is found in the current Directory.*

***What is Error-Code "0x0F"?***

- *This Error-Code displays if any of the Save-Data has an Invalid Health ammount, or hasn't been opened.*

# Upcoming Updates:
- BattleMiner (2014) Update - ***Expect By: 03/01/2023.***
